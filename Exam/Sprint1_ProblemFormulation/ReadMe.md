# **Project Title: Can We Prevent School Shootings in the USA?**

## **Sprint 1: Problem Formulation**

### **Context**
School shootings are a tragic and repeated event in the USA. We frequently hear about these incidents in the news or see them discussed on social media.

### **Purpose**
The primary purpose of this project is to analyze how various factors, such as state gun ownership regulations, 
correlate with the frequency of school shootings, in order to identify data-driven solutions that could help reduce 
them from happening in the future.

### **Research Questions**
- Why do school shootings happen?
- What trends or factors can be identified in school shootings?
- How do state gun regulations correlate with the frequency of school shootings?

### **Hypothesis**
*States with more relaxed gun ownership regulations experience a higher frequency of school shootings compared to states with stricter gun control policies.*

## **Project Overview**

### **Challenge to Address**
Our project aims to investigate whether state gun regulations play a significant role in influencing the frequency of school shootings in the USA. 
We aim to analyze patterns in these tragic events to provide actionable insights that could potentially prevent them in the future.

### **Importance of the Research Goal**
This research is critical because school shootings continue to happen at an alarming rate, 
despite public demands for change. 

### **Expected Solution**
Through analysis, we hope to determine if factors such as gun control laws play a significant role in school shootings. 
By identifying key trends, we aim to provide recommendations that could guide policy changes.

### **Positive Impact**
The outcome of this project could benefit:
- **Students, teachers, and school communities** across the USA by providing insights into preventive measures.
- **Policymakers** who could use data-backed research to implement stronger regulations.
- **Society as a whole**, by contributing to the ongoing conversation on how to reduce gun violence in schools.
